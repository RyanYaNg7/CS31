<h2>More Things about Strings</h2>
</div>
<p>
A string is a sequence of zero or more characters.  The <code>size</code>
function tells you how many characters are in the string:
</p>
<pre>
        string s = "Hello";
        cout &lt&lt; s.size();   // writes 5
        s = "Wow";
        cout &lt;&lt; s.size();   // writes 3
        s = "";
        cout &lt;&lt; s.size();   // writes 0
</pre>
<p>
(For historical reasons, there is also a <code>length</code> function that
returns the same value that <code>size</code> does.  In other words,
<code>s.length()</code> and <code>s.size()</code> may be used interchangeably.)
</p>
<p>
You can access individual characters in a string using the <code>[]</code>
operator.  The positions of the characters in a string are numbered from left
to right, starting at 0.  Your program's behavior is undefined if it tries to
access a character at a position that is out of range for the string.
</p>
<pre>
                                 //  01234
        string s = "Hello";      //  Hello
        cout &lt;&lt; s[0];      // writes H
        cout &lt;&lt; s[4];      // writes o
        cout &lt;&lt; s[6];      // Undefined behavior!
        cout &lt;&lt; s[-1];     // Undefined behavior!
</pre>
<p>
To visit every character in a string (for example, to write each character of
the string on a line by itself), you can say
</p>
<pre>
        string s = "Hello";
        for (int k = 0; k != s.size(); k++)
                cout &lt;&lt; s[k] &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>
<p>
[You don't have to read the <a href="#sizet">nerdy footnote</a> at the bottom
of this page that has something to say about the loop above.]
</p>
<p>
Another thing you can do with a string is to append characters to the end
of the string.  The <code>+=</code> operator lets you do this.  (This is
a different use of the operator than the one that lets you add a number
to an <code>int</code> or <code>double</code> variable.)  Here's an example
where we copy all of the non-blank characters from the string <code>s</code>
to the string <code>t</code>:
</p>
<pre>
        string s = "Hello there!  How are you?";
        string t;   // automatically initialized to the empty string
        for (size_t k = 0; k != s.size(); k++)
	{
            if (s[k] != ' ')   // If s[k] is not a blank
                t += s[k];     //   append s[k] to t
	}
        cout &lt;&lt; t;  //  writes Hellothere!Howareyou?
</pre>
<p>
Notice that when talking about constants representing single characters, we
use single quote marks, not double quote marks.  C++ distinguishes between
the type <code>string</code>, objects of which are sequences of zero or more
characters, and the type <code>char</code>, objects of which are always a
single character.  If <code>s</code> is a <code>string</code>, then the
expression <code>s[k]</code> is a <code>char</code>.  The language lets us
compare a <code>char</code> with another <code>char</code>, like the
constants <code>'&nbsp;'</code> or <code>'@'</code> or <code>'A'</code>.
(The single quotes denote a <code>char</code> constant.)
</p>
<p>
You are also able to copy a substring of a string.  For example, here's how
we can copy the substring of <code>s</code> starting at position 5 and going
for 3 characters:
</p>
<pre>
                                  // 012345678
        string s = "duplicate";   // duplicate
        cout &lt;&lt; s.substr(5,3);    // writes cat 
</pre>
<p>
Here's how to clip off the first six characters of a string:
</p>
<pre>
        string t = "fingernail";
        t = t.substr(6, t.size()-6);  // t is now "nail"
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes we want to classify characters, asking, for example, whether they
are letter characters or digit characters.  If you say
<p>
<pre>
        #include &lt;cctype>
</pre>
<p>
then you can use character classification functions like these:
</p>
<pre>
                                //  01234567
        string s = "Maroon 5";  //  Maroon 5
        if (isalpha(s[0]))  // true, since 'M' is a letter
          ...
        if (isupper(s[0]))  // true, since 'M' is an uppercase letter
          ...
        if (islower(s[2]))  // true, since 'r' is a lowercase letter
          ...
        if (isdigit(s[7]))  // true, since '5' is a digit character
          ...
        if (islower(s[0]))  // false, since 'M' is not a lowercase letter
          ...
        if (isalpha(s[6]))  // false, since ' ' is not a letter
          ...
        if (isalpha(s[7]))  // false, since '5' is not a letter
          ...
</pre>
<p>
This code copies all non-letters in a string:
</p>
<pre>
        string s = "#1 in 2017: Yeah!";
        string t;
        for (size_t k = 0; k != s.size(); k++)
            if (!isalpha(s[k]))  // if not a letter
                t += s[k];       //   append it to t

        // t is now "#1  2017: !"
</pre>
<p>
The function <code>tolower</code>, when given an uppercase letter, returns
the lowercase equivalent of that letter; when given any other character,
just returns that same character.  So
</p>
<pre>
        string s = "Don't SHOUT!";
	string t;
        for (size_t k = 0; k != s.size(); k++)
	    t += tolower(s[k]);
        cout &lt;&lt; t;
</pre>
<p>
writes <code>don't shout!</code>.  Similarly, the function <code>toupper</code>
returns the uppercase equivalent of a letter.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more you can do with strings and characters, but the information
in this tutorial will suffice to enable you to do Project 3.
</p>
<h3>Visual C++: <code>s[k]</code> when <code>k</code> is out of range</h3>
<p>
We've seen that we can access the character of a string <code>s</code> at
position <code>k</code>:
</p>
<pre>
        string s = "Hello";
        cout &lt;&lt; s[0];      // writes H
        cout &lt;&lt; s[4];      // writes o
</pre>
<p>
If <code>k</code> is an integer such that <code>k</code> >= 0 and
<code>k</code> &lt; <code>s.size()</code>, then <code>s[k]</code> refers
to the character at position <code>k</code> of the string <code>s</code>. 
But what if <code>k</code> &lt; 0 or <code>k</code> >= <code>s.size()</code>?
The C++ Standard says that <code>s[k]</code> in this case has undefined
behavior:  The program might crash, or access memory that is not part of the
string, or appear to work normally, or appear to work for a while and then
misbehave, or print a useful diagnostic message, etc.  Different compilers
might do different things at different times.
</p>
<p>
When you build a Visual C++ project in the Debug configuration, which is
what we're doing, the Visual C++ 2017 library's implementation of the
<code>[]</code> operator for strings will, in fact, usually check to see
if the position is within range, and if not, immediately terminate the
program, putting up a dialog box containing the text <em>Debug Assertion
Failed!</em> and <em>string subscript out of range</em>.  This alone is
useful in that it alerts you to a problem, but the real payoff comes if
you know something about using the Visual C++ 2017 debugger.
</p>
<p>
If your program uses the <code>[]</code> operator for strings and dies
when run under Visual C++ 2017, producing the dialog box with the message
<em>string subscript out of range</em>, you can click Retry to fire up the
debugger.  (Annoyingly, after clicking Retry, you will have to select
"Debug the program" in the next dialog box that comes up, and then in the
next box, select the Possible Debugger that has the name of your project, and
click Yes.  In the next dialog box that appears, click Break.)  In the
Call Stack window, double-click the line just <em>below</em> the one containing
"<em>yourProject</em>.exe!std::basic_string&lt;char,...".  You'll then see
your program code, with an arrow in the left margin pointing to one of the
lines of code.  Somewhere in the indicated line in your program code is
your bad subscript; you can examine the Autos window to see the values of
any variables involved.  Select Debug / Stop Debugging when you're
finished exploring.
</p>
<h3>Xcode on a Mac: <code>s[k]</code> when <code>k</code> is out of range</h3>
<p>
There's no simple way to get an immediate error message from evaluating the
expression <code>s[k]</code> when <code>k</code> is out of range.  You should
periodically run your program under Visual C++ or under g++ on the SEASnet
Linux server as you're developing it to detect these kinds of errors, and
you should certainly do it if you're spending time trying to track down a
bug, since the error message should indicate the statement where the
problem is exhibited.
</p>

<h3>Nerdy footnote</h3>
<p>
While a loop starting
</p>
<pre>
        for (int k = 0; k != s.size(); k++)
</pre>
<p>
will work for everything you're doing in this class, technically the
expression <code>s.size()</code> returns a number of a special type
defined in the library:  not <code>int</code>, but
<code>string::size_type</code>.  This type name is a synonym for some
unsigned integer type.  (An unsigned integer variable can contain only
whole numbers, no negatives.)  It turns out that a consequence of the C++
expression rules is that if <code>k</code> is an <code>int</code>, the loop
above might not work correctly for strings over 2 billion characters long,
and the compiler might give you a warning about that, phrased as a
"signed/unsigned mismatch" or a "comparison between signed and unsigned integer
expressions".  Since we won't be using such ridiculously long strings,
declaring <code>k</code> to be an <code>int</code> is fine.
</p>
<p>
Still, it's good practice to try to get a clean build with no warnings.  Like
the boy who cried wolf, if the compiler gives you many warnings about things
that are harmless, you won't notice the warnings you should take seriously.
To eliminate the warning you might get, you should declare k to be of the
technically proper type:
</p>
<pre>
        for (string::size_type k = 0; k != s.size(); k++)
</pre>
<p>
Most C++ library implementations make <code>size_t</code> synonymous with
<code>string::size_type</code>, so you can get away with the somewhat shorter
</p>
<pre>
        for (size_t k = 0; k != s.size(); k++)
</pre>
<p>
Again, you don't <em>have</em> to do this; you can declare <code>k</code> to
be an <code>int</code> if you like, but in that case be prepared for possible
(harmless) signed/unsigned warnings.
</p>
<p>
If you do choose to declare <code>k</code> to be of type
<code>string::size_type</code> or <code>size_t</code>, you need to be sure
that you never try to make <code>k</code> negative.  For example, if you try to
traverse a string backward, then your saying
</p>
<pre>
	for (string::size_type k = s.size()-1; k &gt;= 0; k--)  // WRONG
	{
		... s[k] ...
	}
</pre>
<p>
would lead to undefined behavior.  (If an unsigned integer <code>k</code> is 0
when you execute <code>k--</code>, it will end up with a huge positive
value.  An unsigned integer is always &gt;= 0, so we execute the loop body
and try to talk about a character at a position way past the end of the
string.)  One correct way to write the loop is
</p>
<pre>
	string::size_type k = s.size();
	while (k &gt; 0)
	{
		k--;
		... s[k] ...
	}
</pre>
<p>
Again, if we choose to make <code>k</code> an <code>int</code>, the
<code>for</code> loop version would be fine, but we'd get the (harmless)
signed/unsigned warning.
</p>
