<h2>Make a Comment about CS 31</h2>
<p>
It seems rather silly to wait for the end-of-quarter evaluation forms
before I find out what you think about the class, what could be improved,
etc.  (That may help people taking the class in the future, but not you now!)
</p><p>
Here's your chance to make an anonymous comment about the class.
If your comment is specific to only your lecture section, please identify
which section you're talking about.
</p><p>
You're anonymous, so don't ask something to which you want me to mail you
back a response, since I wouldn't know where to send it.  Don't use this
form to ask for clarifications of the assignments, since I don't read
these comments as often as I read my email.
