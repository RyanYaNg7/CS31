<h2>Homework 2</h2>
<p>
<strong>Time due: 11:00 PM Tuesday, October 17</strong>
</p>
</div>
<p>
Prepare your solutions to these homework problems as a single Word
document named <strong>hw.docx</strong> or <strong>hw.doc</strong>, or a
plain text file named <strong>hw.txt</strong>.  Turn in this file as
described in the <a href="spec.html#hw">Project 2 specification</a>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is the output produced by the following program segment?  Don't just
run it &mdash; trace through it and figure it out by hand (which is a skill
you'll need for the exams).
<pre>
	string grendel = "endl";
	cout &lt;&lt; "endl";
	cout &lt;&lt; grendel;
	cout &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; "grendel";
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Consider the following program:
<pre>
	#include &lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    int side;

	    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a number: ";
	    cin >> side;

	    for (int i = 0; i &lt; side; i++)
	    {
		for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--)
		{
		    cout &lt;&lt; "#";
		}
		cout &lt;&lt; "\n";
	    }
	}
</pre>
<p>
In a brief, simple English sentence, state what this program does (e.g. "It
prints a map of the Lost Angels County bus system.").  Again, figure this
out by hand.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Copy the program in problem 2 and change it so that for any input number, the
changed program produces <em>exactly</em> the same output as the original,
but the changed program uses a while loop instead of a for loop for the
inner loop.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Copy the program you wrote for problem 3 and change it so that for any
input number, the changed program produces <em>exactly</em> the same output
as the original, but uses a do-while loop instead of a for loop for the
outer loop.  Be careful! (Hint: How does it behave if <code>side</code> is
not positive?)  You may need to add a little additional code to make sure
the program behaves identically to the program in problem 3.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Assume <code>codeSection</code> has been previously declared as an
<code>int</code> and given as its value the number of a section of the
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=PEN"
target="_blank">California Penal Code</a>.  Write a switch statement that for
any value of <code>codeSection</code>, produces exactly the same output as
the following if statement.
<pre>
	if (codeSection == 281)
		cout &lt;&lt; "bigamy";
	else if (codeSection == 321  ||  codeSection == 322)
		cout &lt;&lt; "selling illegal lottery tickets";
	else if (codeSection == 383)
		cout &lt;&lt; "selling rancid butter";
	else if (codeSection == 598)
		cout &lt;&lt; "wounding a bird in a public cemetery";
	else
		cout &lt;&lt; "some other crime";
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</body>
