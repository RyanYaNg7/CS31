<h2>Programming Assignment 2<br />
It's Not Fare!</h2>
<p>
<strong>Time due: 11:00 PM Tuesday, October 17</strong>
</p>
</div>
<p style="font-size: smaller">
Before you ask a question about this specification, see if it has already
been addressed by the <a href="faq.html">Project 2 FAQ</a>.  And read the
FAQ before you turn in this project, to be sure you didn't misinterpret
anything.
</p>
<p>
(Be sure you also do the <a href="hw.html">homework</a> accompanying this
project.)
</p>
<p>
You are a software developer for the Lost Angels County Department of
Transportation.  Bus riders in the county may purchase fare tickets.  You
have been assigned to write a program that prints these tickets.
</p>
<p>
Your program must accept as input the rider's destination, the number of zone
boundaries crossed, the rider's age, and whether or not the rider is a
student.  The output will repeat the destination and tell the fare.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of a dialog with the program (user input is shown in
<strong>boldface</strong>):
</p>
<pre>
	Age of rider: <strong>21</strong>
	Student? (y/n): <strong>n</strong>
	Destination: <strong>Bay City</strong>
	Number of zone boundaries crossed: <strong>2</strong>
	---
	The fare to Bay City is $2.45
</pre>
<p>
The fare is $1.35 plus $0.55 per zone boundary crossed, unless a discount
applies:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Riders under 18 get a break for short trips:  For trips crossing 0 or 1
zone boundaries, the fare is $0.65
</li><li>
For trips crossing 0 or 1 zone boundaries, students 18 or over get the
same break as riders under 18.
</li><li>
The senior fare for riders 65 and over is $0.55 plus $0.25 per zone
boundary crossed.  However, for a trip crossing 0 boundaries, the senior
fare is only $0.45.  Seniors who believe in lifelong learning (i.e., are
students) are no dummies:  They pay the cheapest fare available to them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here's another example:
</p>
<pre>
	Age of rider: <strong>22</strong>
	Student? (y/n): <strong>y</strong>
	Destination: <strong>Jollywood</strong>
	Number of zone boundaries crossed: <strong>1</strong>
	---
	The fare to Jollywood is $0.65
</pre>
<p>
You can test your understanding of the fare schedule by experimenting
with the <a href="calc.html">fare calculator</a> we found at the Lost Angels
County Department of Transportation website.
</p><p>
Your program must collect the information for one transaction in the manner
indicated by the examples, and then write to <code>cout</code> a line with
three hyphens only (no spaces or other characters), followed by exactly
one line in a format required below.  Our grading tool will judge the
correctness of your program by examining only the line following the line
with three hyphens (and verifying that there are no additional lines).
That one line you write must be in one of the following five forms; the
text must be <strong>identical</strong> to what is shown, except that
<em>italicized</em> items are replaced as appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the rider's age is negative:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age must not be negative</code>
</li><li>
If the student status is not <code>y</code> or <code>n</code> (must be lower
case):<br /><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must enter y or n</code>
</li><li>
If nothing was provided for the destination:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must enter a destination</code>
</li><li>
If the number of zone boundaries crossed is negative:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of zone boundaries crossed must not be negative</code>
</li><li>
If the input is valid and none of the preceding situations holds:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fare to <em>destination</em> is $<em>amount</em></code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the last case, <em>destination</em> must be the destination as entered, and
<em>amount</em> must be the correct answer, shown as a non-negative number
with at least one digit to the left and exactly two digits to the right of
the decimal point.  (See p. 32-33 of the Savitch book.)  The lines you
write must not start with any spaces.  If you are not a good speller or
typist, or if English is not your first language, be especially careful
about duplicating the messages <strong>exactly</strong>.  Here are some
foolish mistakes that may cause you to get no points for correctness on
this project, no matter how much time you put into it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Not writing to <code>cout</code> a line with exactly three hyphens in
<em>all</em> cases.</li>
<li>Writing any spaces on the line that is supposed to have three hyphens.</li>
<li>Writing more than one line after the line with three hyphens.  Don't,
for example, add a gratuitous "Thank you for riding a Lost Angels County bus."
</li>
<li>Writing lines to <code>cerr</code> instead of <code>cout</code>.</li>
<li>Writing lines like these:
<pre>
	The fair to Redundant Beach is $1.05   <em>misspelling</em>
	The Fare to Redundant Beach is $1.05   <em>wrong capitalization</em>
	The fare for Redundant Beach is $1.05  <em>wrong text</em>
	The fare to Redundant Beach is $ 1.05  <em>extra space</em>
	The fare to Redundant Beach is $1.05.  <em>extra period</em>
	The fare to Redundant Beach is $1.050  <em>extra digit</em>
<!--
	The fare to Unseeno is $1              <em>missing decimal point and digits</em>
-->
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your program must gather the age, the student status, the destination type, and
the number of zone boundaries crossed in that order.  However, if you
detect an error in an item, you do not have to request or get the
remaining items if you don't want to; just be sure you write to
<code>cout</code> the line of three hyphens, the required message and
nothing more after that.  If instead you choose to gather all input first
before checking for any errors, and you detect more than one error, then
after writing the line of three hyphens, write only the error message for
the earliest erroneous item.
</p>
<p>
You will not write any loops in this program.  This means that each time
you run the program, it handles only one bus ticket transaction.  It also
means that in the case of bad input, you must not keep prompting the user
until you get something acceptable; our grading tool will not recognize
that you're doing that.
</p>
<p>
A string with no characters in it is the empty string.  A string with at
least one character in it is not the empty string, even if the only
characters in it are things like spaces or tabs.  Although realistically
it would be silly to have a destination name consisting of seventeen
spaces and nothing more, treat that as you would any other non-empty
string:  as a valid name.  (Since you don't yet know how to check for that
kind of situation anyway, we're not requiring you to.)
</p>
<p>
The one kind of input error your program does <strong>not</strong> have to
deal with is the case of not finding an integer in the input where an integer
is expected.  Our grading tool will not, for example, supply the text
<code>Granola Hills</code> or the number <code>23.456</code> when your
program requests a rider's age.
</p>
<p>
The correctness of your program must not depend on undefined program behavior.
Your program could not, for example, assume anything about <code>n</code>'s
value at the point indicated:
</p>
<pre>
	int main()
	{
	    int n;
	    int m = 42 * n;  // n's value is undefined
	    &hellip;
</pre>
<p>
What you will turn in for this assignment is a zip file containing these
three files and nothing more:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
A text file named <strong>fare.cpp</strong> that contains the source
code for your C++ program.  Your source code should have helpful comments
that tell the purpose of the major program segments and explain any tricky
code.
</li><li>
A file named <strong>report.docx</strong> or <strong>report.doc</strong>
(in Microsoft Word format) or <strong>report.txt</strong> (an ordinary
text file) that contains:
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
<li>
A brief description of notable obstacles you overcame.  (In Project 1, for
example, some people had the problem of figuring out how to work with more
than one version of a program in Visual C++.)
</li><li>
A list of the test data that could be used to thoroughly test your
program, along with the reason for each test.  You don't have to include
the results of the tests, but you must note which test cases your program
does not handle correctly.  (This could happen if you didn't have time to
write a complete solution, or if you ran out of time while still debugging
a supposedly complete solution.)  For Project 1, for example, such a list,
had it been required, might have started off like this:
<dl>
<dt></dt><dd>More surveyed than the total expressing approval and disapproval (1000, 413, 382
)</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>Fewer surveyed than the total expressing approval and disapproval (500, 413, 382
)</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>Zero people surveyed (0, 100, 100)</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>Data giving a non-integer percentage (1000, 413, 382)</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>More expressing approval than disapproval (1000, 413, 382)</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>Equal numbers expressing approval and disapproval (1000, 500, 500)</dd>
<dt></dt><dd>&hellip;</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</li><li>
<a name="hw"></a>
A file named <strong>hw.docx</strong> or <strong>hw.doc</strong> (in
Microsoft Word format) or <strong>hw.txt</strong> (an ordinary text file)
that contains your solution to the <a href="hw.html">homework</a>
accompanying Project 2.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
By October 16, there will be links on the class webpage that will enable you
<!--
The <a href="../../Submit/submission.cgi?asst=2">turn in Project 2</a>
link on the class webpage enables you
-->
to turn in your zip file electronically.  Turn in the file by the due time
above.  Give yourself enough time to be sure you can turn something in,
because we will not accept excuses like "My network connection at home was
down, and I didn't have a way to copy my files and bring them to a SEASnet
machine."  There's a lot to be said for turning in a preliminary version
of your program, report, and homework early (You can always overwrite it
with a later submission).  That way you have something submitted in case
there's a problem later.  Notice that most of the test data portion of
your report can be written from the requirements in this specification,
before you even start designing your program.
</p><p>
The writeup <a href="../../strings.html">Some Things about Strings</a>
tells you what you need to know about strings for this project.
</p><p>
As you develop your program, periodically try it out under another compiler
(g31 on cs31.seas.ucla.edu if you're doing your primary development using
Visual C++ or Xcode).  Sometimes one compiler will warn you about
something that another is silent about, so you may be able to find and fix
more errors sooner.  If running your program under both environments with
the same input gives you different results, your program is probably
relying on undefined behavior (such as using the value of an uninitialized
variable), which we prohibit.
