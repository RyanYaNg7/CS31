<strong>How do I terminate the program other than by reaching the end of
<code>main()</code>?</strong>
</p><p>
You can do something like this:
</p>
<pre>
	int main()
	{
	    <em>do some stuff</em>
	    if (<em>something bad happened</em>)
	    {
	        <em>write an error message</em>
	        return 1;    <em>// non-zero value means failure</em>
	    }
	    <em>do some more stuff</em>
	}
</pre>
<p>
If something bad happens, this will write an error message and terminate the
program without doing some more stuff.
</p>
</li>

<p>
<strong>When I run my program, why does the dialog proceed like this?</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	Age of rider: <strong>19</strong>
	Student? (y/n): Destination: 
</pre>
<strong>Why didn't it give me a chance to type y or n for the student
status?</strong>
</p><p>
If you had read the <a href="../../strings.html">Some Things about Strings</a>
writeup, you'd know why.  (Look at the discussion of the Floral Tapestry
example and the use of <code>cin.ignore(&hellip;)</code>.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Should the very last character my program writes be a newline?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It won't matter to our grading tool, but it's better style.  In other words,
if the last line your program is going to write in some cases is <code>You
must enter y or n</code>, then saying
</p>
<pre>
	cout << "You must enter y or n" << endl;
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
	cout << "You must enter y or n\n";
</pre>
<p>
is better than
</p>
<pre>
	cout << "You must enter y or n";
</pre>
<p>
with no further output.  Oh, and don't worry about the <code>Press any key
to continue</code> message.  That's something the Visual Studio environment
writes after your program finishes, but the way our grading tool runs your
program, that message isn't produced.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is zero negative?</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Negative.html" target="_blank">No</a>
&mdash; never was, never will be.  Why would you think that when we use a
word in a specification, we're using some idiosyncratic definition like
<a href="http://www.sabian.org/Alice/lgchap06.htm" target="_blank">Humpty
Dumpty</a> would?  There's glory for you!  Anyway, perhaps you should
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140296476/"
target="_blank">learn a bit more about zero</a>.

<p>
<strong>My program behaves weirdly when, in response to the second
prompt, I type <i>you betcha!</i> or some other phrase.  Why?</strong>
</p><p>
You're probably using a <code>char</code> for the response instead of a
<code>string</code>.  Read the response into a <code>string</code> using
<code>getline</code> &mdash; that will make it easier to write a program
that behaves according to the spec.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>I wrote the program and now I'm trying to get it to work.  It's not
reading the input correctly, it's printing multiple messages, and many output
numbers are wrong.  What can I do?</strong>
</p><p>
Most importantly, learn this lesson from your mistake:  You should develop
your programs incrementally.  It seems that you did not do this; instead,
you wrote a lot of code and then tried to test it, so all the problems
with your code are hitting you at once.
</p><p>
It may seem like a step backward, but what you should do is start over again.
Create a new project and solve a simplified version of the problem.  For
example, assume the user will always enter correct input, and have your
program use a very simple fare formula (e.g., the fare is always $1.35
plus $0.55 per zone boundary crossed, without any discounts).  Get that
working, making sure the format of any output you write is correct.  Once
you get that working, enhance the program to check for an invalid rider
age, and make sure your code does what's required for both valid and
invalid ages.  Then add checking for an invalid reponse to the student
question and test the code.  Continuing to add error-checking code in this
fashion, you should end up with a program that does everything except
always computing the right fare amount in the case of valid input.
</p><p>
That's a good state to be in, because now you know the only thing you have to
do is change the computation of the fare; that's independent of everything
else you've written and know to be correct.  Since the actual fare
calculation rules are complex, continue by implementing a simplification
that's only a little more complex than your original simplification.  For
example, ignore the senior discount.  Get that working.  Add in correctly
handling seniors.  Get that working.  You're done!
</p><p>
At each step where you've got something working, save a copy of the program.
That way, if you mangle things up in the next phase, or you run out of time,
you'll be able to turn in a program that will compile and pass at least
some of our test cases.  That beats getting a zero for correctness!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>I've tested my program thoroughly and I believe my program is behaving
the way it's required to.  How can I shake the feeling I have, though, that
I might have overlooked something fundamental that will cost me a lot of
correctness points when your testing script runs it?</strong>
</p><p>
Follow the instructions in the <a href="../../linux.html">g++ with Linux</a>
writeup to run your program on the SEASnet Linux server.  Then, when you are
satisfied that it works, run this command on that server:
</p>
<pre>
	curl -s -L http://cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs31/Utilities/p2tester | bash
</pre>
It will test your program on a couple of cases in the manner that our testing
script will.  (Of course, our testing script will test many more cases than
just a couple.)
