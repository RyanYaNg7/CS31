<p>
You have been contracted by the producers of the highly-rated Star Search
game show to write a program that lets fans play a home version of the
game.  Here's how one round of the game works:  The computer picks a secret
word of four to six letters and tells the player how many letters are in the
word.  The player tries to determine the secret word by presenting
the computer with a series of probe words.  Each probe word is a four to six
letter word.  If the probe word is the secret word, the player wins.
Otherwise, the computer responds to the probe word with two integers:  the
number of stars and the number of planets.  Stars and planets are pairings 
between a letter in the probe word and the same letter in the secret word.
A <em>star</em> is a pairing of a letter in the probe word and the same letter
in the secret word in the same position.  A <em>planet</em> is a pairing
between a letter in the probe word and the same letter in the secret word,
but <em>not</em> in the same position as in the probe word, provided that
neither of the two letters are involved in a star or another planet.  The
player's score for each round is the number of probe words needed to get
the correct word (counting the probe word that matched the secret word).
</p><p>
(The terms <em>star</em> and <em>planet</em> come from the astronomical
objects; stars have a fixed position in the sky relative to other stars,
while planets appear to wander relative to the stars.)
</p><p>
As an example, suppose the secret word is EGRET.  Here are some examples of
the star and planet counts for various probe words:
</p>
<pre>

	EGRET        EGRET        EGRET        EGRET
	GOOSE        RAGE         EERIE        EERIE
	p   p        p ps         sps     or   s s p
      0 s / 2 p    1 s / 2 p    2 s / 1 p    2 s / 1 p
 
	EGRET        EGRET        EGRET        EGRET
	GREET        OKAPI        REGRET  or   REGRET
	pppss                     ppp pp        ppppp
      2 s / 3 p    0 s / 0 p    0 s / 5 p    0 s / 5 p
</pre>
<p>
Your program must ask the player how many rounds to play, and then play
that many rounds of the game.  After each round, the program must display
some statistics about how well the player has played the rounds so far: 
the average score, the minimum score, and the maximum score.
</p><p>
Here is an example of how the program must interact with the player
(player input is in <strong>boldface</strong>):
</p>
<pre>
	How many rounds do you want to play? <strong>3</strong>

	Round 1
	The secret word is 5 letters long.
	Probe word: <strong>assert</strong>
	Stars: 1, Planets: 2
	Probe word: <strong>xyzzy</strong>
	I don't know that word.
	Probe word: <strong>bred</strong>
	Stars: 0, Planets: 2
	Probe word: <strong>mucus</strong>
	Stars: 0, Planets: 0
	Probe word: <strong>never</strong>
	Stars: 2, Planets: 2
	Probe word: <strong>enter</strong>
	Stars: 1, Planets: 2
	Probe word: <strong>river</strong>
	Stars: 3, Planets: 0
	Probe word: <strong>raven</strong>
	You got it in 7 tries.
	Average: 7.00, minimum: 7, maximum: 7

	Round 2
	The secret word is 5 letters long.
	Probe word: <strong>eerie</strong>
	Stars: 2, Planets: 1
	Probe word: <strong>rage</strong>
	Stars: 1, Planets: 2
	Probe word: <strong>greet</strong>
	Stars: 2, Planets: 3
	Probe word: <strong>egret</strong>
	You got it in 4 tries.
	Average: 5.50, minimum: 4, maximum: 7

	Round 3
	The secret word is 4 letters long.
	Probe word: <strong>monkey</strong>
	Stars: 0, Planets: 0
	Probe word: <strong>puma</strong>
	Stars: 0, Planets: 0
	Probe word: <strong>Hello</strong>
	Your probe word must be a word of 4 to 6 lower case letters.
	Probe word: <strong>what?</strong>
	Your probe word must be a word of 4 to 6 lower case letters.
	Probe word: <strong>wrap-up</strong>
	Your probe word must be a word of 4 to 6 lower case letters.
	Probe word: <strong>stop it</strong>
	Your probe word must be a word of 4 to 6 lower case letters.
	Probe word: <strong>sigh</strong>
	You got it in 3 tries.
	Average: 4.67, minimum: 3, maximum: 7
</pre>
<p>
Notice that unknown words and probe strings that don't consist of exactly 4 to
6 lower case letters don't count toward the number of tries for a round.
</p><p>
You can assume the player will always enter an integer for the number of rounds
(since you haven't learned a clean way to check that yet).  If the number of
rounds entered is not positive, write the message
</p>
<pre>
	The number of rounds must be positive.
</pre>
<p>
(not preceded by an empty line) and terminate the program immediately.
</p><p>
The program will be divided across three files:  <code>stars.cpp</code>, which
you will write; <a href="utilities.h"><code>utilities.h</code></a>, which we
have written and which you must not change; and
<a href="utilities.cpp"><code>utilities.cpp</code></a>, which we have written
and you must not change.  You will turn in only <code>stars.cpp</code>;
when we test your program, our test framework will supply
<code>utilities.h</code> and our own special testing version of
<code>utilities.cpp</code>.
</p><p>
In order for us to thoroughly test your program, it must have at least the
following components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In <code>stars.cpp</code>, a main routine that declares an array of C
strings.  This array exists to hold the list of words from which the
secret word will be selected.  The response to a probe word will be the
number of stars and planets only if the probe word is in this array. (From
the example transcript above, we deduce that "xyzzy" is not in the array.)
The declared number of C strings in the array must be at least 9000. 
(You can declare it to be larger if you like, and you don't have to use
every element.)
</p><p>
Each element of the array must be capable of holding a C string of
length up to 6 letters (thus 7 characters counting the zero byte).  So a
declaration such as <code>char wordList[9000][7];</code> is fine, although
something like <code>char wordList[MAXWORDS][MAXWORDLEN+1];</code>, with the
constants suitably defined, would be stylistically better.
</p><p>
Along with the array, your main routine must declare an int that will
contain the actual number of words in the array (i.e., elements 0 through
one less than that number are the elements that contain the C strings of
interest).  The number may well be smaller than the declared size of the array,
because for test purposes you may not want to fill the entire array.
</p><p>
Before prompting the player for the number of rounds to play, your main
routine must call <code>getWords</code> (see below) to fill the array.
The only valid words in the game will be those that <code>getWords</code>
puts into this array.
</p><p>
If the player's score for a round is not 1, the message reporting the score
must be
</p>
<pre>
	You got it in <em>n</em> tries.
</pre>
where <em>n</em> is the score.  If the score is 1, the message must be
</p>
<pre>
	You got it in 1 try.
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In <code>utilities.cpp</code>, a function named <code>getWords</code>
with the following prototype: </p>
<pre>
	int getWords(char words[][7], int maxWords, const char wordfilename[]);
</pre>
<p>
(Instead of <code>7</code>, you can use something like
<code>MAXWORDLEN+1</code>, where <code>MAXWORDLEN</code> is declared
to be the constant 6, as in <code>utilities.h</code>.)  This function puts
words into the <code>words</code> array and returns the number of words
put into the array.  The array must be able to hold at least
<code>maxWords</code> words.  The file named by the third argument is the
plain text file that contains the words, one per line, that will be put into
the array.
</p><p>
You <em>must</em> call <code>getWords</code> exactly once, before you
start playing any of the rounds of the game.  If your main routine
declares <code>wordList</code> to be an array of 10000 C strings and
<code>nWords</code> to be an int, you'll probably invoke this
function like this:
</p>
<pre>
	const char WORDFILENAME[] = "<em>the path for the word file</em>";
	...
	int nWords = getWords(wordList, 10000, WORDFILENAME);
</pre>
<p>
You may use <a href="words.txt">this 7265-word file</a> if you want a
challenging game.  Here's how you'd specify the path to the word file for
various systems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Windows:  Provide a path for the filename, but use / in the string instead
of the \ that Windows paths use, e.g. <code>"Z:CS31/P5/mywordfile.txt"</code>.
</li><li>
Mac:  It's probably easiest to use the complete pathname to the words
file, e.g. <code>"/Users/<em>yourUsername</em>/words.txt</code>" or
<code>"/Users/<em>yourUsername</em>/CS31/P5/words.txt"</code>.
</li><li>
Linux:  If you put the words.txt file in the same directory as your .cpp
file, you can use <code>"words.txt"</code> as the file name string.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have given you an implementation of <code>getWords</code></a>.  (Don't
worry if you don't understand every part of the implementation.) It fills
the array with the four-to-six-letter words found in the file named as its
third argument.  To do simple testing, you can <em>temporarily</em> change the
implementation of <code>getWords</code> to something like this that
ignores the file name and hard codes a small number of words to be put in
the array:
</p>
<pre>
	int getWords(char words[][7], int maxWords, const char wordfilename[])
	{
	    if (maxWords < 2)
	        return 0;
	    strcpy(words[0], "eagle");
	    strcpy(words[1], "goose");
	    return 2;
	}
</pre>
<p>
Whatever implementation of <code>getWords</code> you use, each C string that
it puts into the array must consist of four to six lower case letters; the
C strings must not contain any characters that aren't lower case letters.
If you have made a temporary change to <code>getWords</code> for test
purposes, be sure to restore <code>utilities.cpp</code> back to its
original state and verify that your program still runs correctly.
</p><p>
The <code>getWords</code> function must return an int no greater than
<code>maxWords</code>.  If it returns a value less than 1, your main
routine must write
</p>
<pre>
	No words were loaded, so I can't play the game.
</pre>
<p>
to <code>cout</code> and terminate the program immediately, without asking
the player for the number of rounds to play, etc.
</p><p>
When we test your program, we will replace <code>utilities.cpp</code> (and
thus any changed implementation of <code>getWords</code> you might have made)
with our own special testing implementation that will ignore the third argument
and fill the array with the test words we want to use.
</p><p>
If <code>getWords</code> returns a value in the range from 1 to
<code>maxWords</code> inclusive, your program must write no output to
<code>cout</code> other than what is required by this spec.  If you want to
print things out for debugging purposes, write to <code>cerr</code>
instead of <code>cout</code>.  When we test your program, we will cause
everything written to <code>cerr</code> to be discarded instead &mdash; we
will never see that output, so you may leave those debugging output
statements in your program if you wish.
</p>
</li>
<li>
In <code>stars.cpp</code>, a function named <code>runOneRound</code>
with the following prototype: <pre>
	int runOneRound(const char words[][7], int nWords, int wordnum);
</pre>
<p>
(Again, instead of <code>7</code>, you can use something like
<code>MAXWORDLEN+1</code>.)  Using <code>words[wordnum]</code> as the
secret word, this function plays one round of the game.  It returns the
score for that round.  In the transcript above, for round 1, for example,
this function is responsible for this much of the round 1 output, no more,
no less:
</p>
<pre>
        Probe word: <strong>assert</strong>
        Stars: 1, Planets: 2
        Probe word: <strong>xyzzy</strong>
        I don't know that word.
        Probe word: <strong>bred</strong>
        Stars: 0, Planets: 2
        Probe word: <strong>mucus</strong>
        Stars: 0, Planets: 0
        Probe word: <strong>never</strong>
        Stars: 2, Planets: 2
        Probe word: <strong>enter</strong>
        Stars: 1, Planets: 2
        Probe word: <strong>river</strong>
        Stars: 3, Planets: 0
        Probe word: <strong>raven</strong>
</pre>
<p>
Your program must call this function to play each round of the game.  Notice
that this function does <em>not</em> select a random number and does
<em>not</em> tell the user the length of the secret word; the
<em>caller</em> of this function does, and passes the random number as the
third argument.  Notice also that this function does <em>not</em> write
the message about the player successfully determining the secret word. 
<strong>If you do not observe these requirements, your program will fail
most test cases.</strong>
</p><p>
The parameter <code>nWords</code> represents the number of words in the array;
if it is not positive, or if <code>wordnum</code> is less than 0 or greater
than or equal to <code>nWords</code>, then <code>runOneRound</code>
must return &minus;1 without writing anything to <code>cout</code>.
</p><p>
If for a probe word the player enters a string that does not contain four
to six lower case letters or contains any character that is not a lower case
letter, the response must be
</p>
<pre>
	Your probe word must be a word of 4 to 6 lower case letters.
</pre>
<p>
If the player enters a string consisting of exactly four to six lower case
letters, but that string is not one of the words in the array of valid
words, then the response must be
</p>
<pre>
	I don't know that word.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To make things interesting, your program must pick secret words at random
using the function <code>randInt</code>, contained in
<code>utilities.cpp</code>:
</p>
<pre>
	int randInt(int min, int max);
</pre>
<p>
Every call to <code>randInt</code> returns a random integer between min
and max, inclusive.  If you use it to generate a random position in an
array of <code>n</code> interesting items, you should invoke it as
<code>randInt(0, n-1)</code>, not <code>randInt(0, n)</code>, since the
latter might return <code>n</code>, which is not a valid position in an
<code>n</code>-element array.
</p><p>
<strong>Your program must <strong>not</strong> use any <code>std::string</code>
objects (C++ strings); you must use C strings.</strong>
</p><p>
You may assume (i.e., we promise when testing your program) that any line
entered in response to the probe word prompt will contain fewer than 100
characters (not counting the newline at the end).
</p><p>
Your program must <strong>not</strong> use any global variables whose values
may change during execution.  Global <em>constants</em> are all right;
it's perfectly fine to declare <code>const int MINWORDLEN = 4;</code>
globally, for example.  The reason for this restriction is that part of
our testing will involve replacing your <code>runOneRound</code>
function with ours to test some aspects of your <code>main</code>
function, or replacing your <code>main</code> with ours to test aspects of
your <code>runOneRound</code>.  For this reason, you must not use any
non-const global variables to communicate between these functions, because
our versions won't know about them; all communication between these
functions must be through the parameters (for <code>main</code> to tell
<code>runOneRound</code> the words, number of words, and secret word
number for a round), and the return value (for <code>runOneRound</code>
to tell <code>main</code> the score for that round).  Global <em>constants</em>
are OK because no function can change their value in order to use them to
pass information to another function.
</p><p>
Microsoft made a controversial decision to issue by default an error or warning
when using certain functions from the standard C and C++ libraries (e.g.,
<code>strcpy</code>).  These warnings call that function unsafe and
recommend using a different function in its place; that function, though, is
not a Standard C++ function, so will cause a compilation failure when you try
to build your program under clang++ or g++.  Therefore, for this class, we do
not want get that error or warning from Visual C++; to eliminate them, put
the following line in your program <em>before</em> any of your
<code>#include</code>s:
</p>
<pre>
	#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE
</pre>
</p><p>
It is OK and harmless to leave that line in when you build your program
using clang++ or g++.
</p><p>
What you will turn in for this assignment is a zip file containing these
two files and nothing more:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
A text file named <strong>stars.cpp</strong> that contains <code>main</code>,
<code>runOneRound</code>, and other functions you choose to write that
they might call.  (You must <em>not</em> put implementations of
<code>getWords</code> or <code>randInt</code> in <code>stars.cpp</code>;
they belong in <code>utilities.cpp</code>.)  Your source code should have
helpful comments that tell the purpose of the major program segments and
explain any tricky code.
</p>
</li>
<li>A file named <strong>report.docx</strong> or <strong>report.doc</strong>
(in Microsoft Word format), or <strong>report.txt</strong> (an ordinary text
file) that contains:
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
<li>A brief description of notable obstacles you overcame.
</li>
<li>A description of the design of your program.  You should use
<a href="../../pseudocode.html">pseudocode</a> in this description where it
clarifies the presentation.  Document the design of your main routine and
any functions you write.  Do not document the <code>getWords</code> or
<code>randInt</code> functions.
</li>
</ol>
Your report does not need to describe the data you might use to test this
program.

</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
This project is having you do two things we haven't done before:  set up a
project with multiple source files and run a program that reads from a file.
Before you delve into the details of writing the code to play the game, you
would be wise to ensure that you can do these two new things correctly.  We
will first have you set up a file with a couple of words in it that your
test program will read.  Then you will set up a project and run the program
to read the file.
</p><p>
First, place <a href="smallwords.txt">this two-word file</a> at a location of
your choosing.  On a Windows or Mac system, make sure you know the complete
path name to the file (e.g., <code>Z:CS31\P5\mywordfile.txt</code> or
<code>C:\Temp\smallwords.txt</code> on a Windows system, or 
<code>/Users/<em>yourUsername</em>/CS31/P5/smallwords.txt</code> on a Mac).
Then, follow the instructions below for the compiler you'll be using.  For the
text of the <code>stars.cpp</code> file, use this:
</p>
<pre>
	#include "utilities.h"
	#include &lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	const char WORDFILENAME[] = "<em>the path to your file of words</em>";

	int main()
	{
	    char w[9000][7];
	    int n = getWords(w, 9000, WORDFILENAME);
	    if (n == 2)
	    {
		cout &lt;&lt; "getWords successfully found the file and read its two words." &lt;&lt; endl;
		cout &lt;&lt; "You're ready to start working on Project 5." &lt;&lt; endl;
	    }
	    else if (n == -1)
		cout &lt;&lt; "The path to your file of words is probably incorrect" &lt;&lt; endl;
	    else
		cout &lt;&lt; "getWords found the file, but loaded " &lt;&lt; n
                     &lt;&lt; " words instead of 2" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Setting up a multi-file Visual C++ project</h3>
Follow these steps to set up a Visual C++ project to compile and run a
three-file program.  A number of these steps may have alternate ways to
achieve the same end.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Follow steps 1 through 4 in the <a href="../../visualcpp.html">Visual C++
2017</a> writeup to create an empty Visual C++ project.
</p></li>
<li><p>
From the Project menu, select Add New Item.  In the Add New Item dialog,
select C++ file (.cpp) in the middle panel.  Enter the source file name
<code>stars</code>, in the Name text box below.  Click Add.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Edit the <code>stars.cpp</code> file in the window that appears.  Insert the
code in the Getting started section.  For the initializer for
<code>WORDFILENAME</code>, replace any \ in the pathname to your words
file with / (e.g., use <code>"Z:CS31/P5/mywordfile.txt"</code> or
<code>/Temp/smallwords.txt"</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
From the Project menu, select Add New Item.  This time, in the Add New
Item dialog, select Header file (.h) in the middle panel and enter the
header file name <code>utilities</code> in the Name text box below.  Copy
and paste <a href="utilities.h">our utilities.h</a> into the
<code>utilities.h</code> file that appears.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
From the Project menu, select Add New Item.  This last time, select C++
file (.cpp) in the middle panel, and enter the source file name
<code>utilities</code> in the Name text box below.  Copy and paste
<a href="utilities.cpp">our utilities.cpp</a> into the
<code>utilities.cpp</code> file that appears.
</p></li>
<li><p>
From the Debug menu, select Start Without Debugging.  This will save any
changed files, compile the source files, and run the resulting executable
if there were no build errors.  (If you select Start Debugging, your
console window screen will disappear as soon as your program finishes
executing, which you don't want.)
</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Setting up a multi-file Xcode project</h3>
<p>
Follow these steps to set up an Xcode project to compile and run a
three-file program.  A number of these steps may have alternate ways to
achieve the same end.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Follow steps 1 through 4 in the <a href="../../xcode.html">Xcode on a Mac</a>
writeup to create a project.  Use <code>stars</code> as the project name
instead of <code>hello</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In the left frame, click once on the name <code>main.cpp</code> to open
the file.  Click once again on the name to rename the file to
<code>stars.cpp</code>.  Once you've clicked outside the text box to
effect the name change, replace the code that Xcode supplied with the code
in the Getting started section.  For the initializer for
<code>WORDFILENAME</code>, use the pathname to your words file (e.g.
<code>/Users/<em>yourUsername</em>/CS31/P5/smallwords.txt</code>).
</p></li>
<li><p>
In the left frame, right click on the yellow folder icon labelled "stars".
In the popup menu, select New File.  Select the macOS tab, and in the Source group,
select C++ File.  Click Next.  Use <code>utilities</code> for the name
and leave the box checked for also creating a header file.  Click Next.  
A save file dialog appears; click Create.  Rename the file that was created
named <code>utilities.hpp</code> to be named <code>utilities.h</code>.
Replace the code in <code>utilities.h</code>  with
<a href="utilities.h">our utilities.h</a>.  Replace the code in
<code>utilities.cpp</code> with <a href="utilities.cpp">our utilities.cpp</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Follow steps 6 through 9 in the <a href="../../xcode.html">Xcode on a Mac</a>
writeup to build and run your program.
</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Running the project using g++ with Linux</h3>
<p>
To take a three-file project you've developed with Visual C++ or Xcode and
run it with g++ under Linux, follow these steps.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Follow steps 1 through 3 of the <a href="linux.html">g++ with Linux</a>
writeup to transfer the three files (<code>utilities.h</code>,
<code>utilities.cpp</code>, and <code>stars.cpp</code>) to the Windows
desktop on a SEASnet machine and to log in to <code>cs31.seas.ucla.edu</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Create a new directory for this project; let's call it <code>proj5</code>:
</p>
<pre>
	mkdir proj5
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
Copy the files from the Desktop to this directory:
</p>
<pre>
	cp Desktop/utilities.* Desktop/stars.cpp proj5
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
Make <code>proj5</code> the <em>current directory</em> (i.e., the default
directory for now in which files will be found or created):
</p>
<pre>
	cd proj5
</pre>

<li><p>
Verify that the expected three files are present by listing the contents of
the current directory:
</p>
<pre>
	ls
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
Copy over the two-word word file into the current directory:
</p>
<pre>
	curl -s -L http://cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs31/Projects/5/smallwords.txt > twowords.txt
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
Use the Nano editor to change the initializer for <code>WORDFILENAME</code> to
<code>"twowords.txt"</code>.
<pre>
	nano stars.cpp
</pre>
<p>
You can navigate with the arrow keys.  The bottom two lines of the display
show you some commands you can type.  For example, control-O (indicated in
the bottom display as <code>^O</code>) saves any changes you make to the
file, and control-X exits the editor.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Build an executable file from the source files.  If we would like the
executable file to be named <code>teststars</code>, we'd say
</p>
<pre>
	g31 -o teststars *.cpp
</pre>
<p>
The <code>*.cpp</code> saves us typing individual file names by matching all
the files whose names end in <code>.cpp</code>.  (Notice that we do not list
the .h file.).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
To execute the program <code>teststars</code> that you built, you'd just say
</p>
<pre>
	teststars
</pre>
<p>
(If that doesn't work, try <code>./teststars</code>)
</p></li>
</ol>
