<h2>Project 5 FAQ</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
What does it mean when in Visual C++ my program dies with a dialog box
appearing saying "Debug Assertion Failed! ... File: ...\src\isctype.c ...
expression: (unsigned)(c+1)<=256" ?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
It means you called one of the functions defined by
<code>&lt;cctype></code>, such as <code>isalpha</code> or <code>tolower</code>,
with a character whose encoding is outside the range of 0 through 127. 
Since all the normal characters you would use (space, letters, punctuation,
<code>'\0'</code>, etc.) fall in that range, you're probably passing an
uninitialized character to the function.  Perhaps you're examining a character
past the <code>'\0'</code> marking the end of a C string, or perhaps you built
what you thought was a C string but forgot to end it with a <code>'\0'</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
The spec describes circumstances under which <code>runOneRound</code>
must return &minus;1.  What should my main routine do in that case?
</strong>
</p>
Since the spec doesn't say, you can do what you like.
</p><p>
If you structure your main routine right, it should never reach a point
where it calls <code>runOneRound</code> if the circumstances under which it
calls that function are such that the function would return &minus;1.  In
a perfect world, you wouldn't need to test for that impossible situation. 
But in the real world, you may have a bug in your main routine that lets
it call <code>runOneRound</code> with bad argument values.  A
reasonable bit of defensive programming would be to test for the &minus;1
return, write a message and terminate the program.
</p><p>
Of course, part of our correctness testing will be to test
<code>runOneRound</code> independently of your main routine.  For those
tests, we'd rename your main routine to something harmless, never call it,
and instead append our own main routine that will, for some tests, pass
arguments to <code>runOneRound</code> that should cause it to return
&minus;1, which we'll check.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>How can I check that I haven't overlooked something fundamental that
will cost me a lot of correctness points when your testing script runs
it?</strong>
</p><p>
While the following is not as thorough as our test cases will be, make sure
you can pass these two tests:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In <code>utilities.cpp</code>, Add the following as the first five lines of
the implementation of <code>getWords</code>:
<pre>
if (maxWords &lt; 2)          // Remove this line after completing Tests 1 and 2
    return 0;              // Remove this line after completing Tests 1 and 2
strcpy(words[0], "crypt"); // Remove this line after completing Tests 1 and 2
strcpy(words[1], "truly"); // Remove this line after completing Tests 1 and 2
return 2;                  // Remove this line after completing Tests 1 and 2
</pre>
</li><li>
Test 1:  Add the following as the first three lines of your implementation of
<code>runOneRound</code>:
<pre>
static int zzz = 3; // Remove this line after completing Test 1
zzz--;              // Remove this line after completing Test 1
return zzz;         // Remove this line after completing Test 1
</pre>
<p>
Build and run your program.  In response to the prompt for the number of rounds
to play, enter <code>2</code>.  The output must match the following
<strong>exactly</strong> &mdash; same spelling, capitalization, spacing,
punctuation, etc.:
</p>
<pre>
How many rounds do you want to play? <strong>2</strong>

Round 1
The secret word is 5 letters long.
You got it in 2 tries.
Average: 2.00, minimum: 2, maximum: 2

Round 2
The secret word is 5 letters long.
You got it in 1 try.
Average: 1.50, minimum: 1, maximum: 2
</pre>
<p>
When you pass this test, remove the three lines you added to
<code>runOneRound</code>.
</p>
</li><li>
Test 2:  Add the following as the first eight lines of your implementation of
<code>main</code>:
<pre>
char zzz[9000][7];                                // Remove this line after completing Test 2
if (getWords(zzz, 9000, "no file used") == 2  &amp;&amp;  // Remove this line after completing Test 2
      runOneRound(zzz, 2, 0) == 1  &amp;&amp;             // Remove this line after completing Test 2
      runOneRound(zzz, 2, 1) == 2)                // Remove this line after completing Test 2
    cout &lt;&lt; "PASSED" &lt;&lt; endl;                     // Remove this line after completing Test 2
else                                              // Remove this line after completing Test 2
    cout &lt;&lt; "FAILED" &lt;&lt; endl;                     // Remove this line after completing Test 2
return 0;                                         // Remove this line after completing Test 2
</pre>
<p>
Build and run your program.  In response to the first prompt for a probe word,
enter <code>crypt</code>.  In response to the second prompt for a probe word,
enter <code>crypt</code>.  In response to the third prompt for a probe word,
enter <code>truly</code>.  The output must match the following
<strong>exactly</strong> &mdash; same spelling, capitalization, spacing,
punctuation, etc.:
</p>
<pre>
Probe word: <strong>crypt</strong>
Probe word: <strong>crypt</strong>
Stars: 1, Planets: 2
Probe word: <strong>truly</strong>
PASSED
</pre>
When you pass this test, remove the eight lines you added to <code>main</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
If a letter could be part of a star or part of a planet, must we prefer one
over another?
</strong>
</p>
Yes.  The wording in the spec doesn't make this clear, although it's
suggested by an example:
</p>
<pre>
	shown: EGRET		 not shown: EGRET
	       RAGE		            RAGE
	       p ps   1 s / 2 p             p pp   0 s / 3 p
	   <em>We want this</em>	                <em>We don't want this</em>
</pre>
<p>
We don't want the E of RAGE to be considered paired with the
<em>first</em> E of EGRET as part of a planet when it could instead be paired
with the <em>second</em> E of EGRET as part of a star.
</p><p>
So here's the rule that you must follow:  If a letter at a particular
position in a word could be considered to be part of a star or part of a
planet, it must be treated as part of a star.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
