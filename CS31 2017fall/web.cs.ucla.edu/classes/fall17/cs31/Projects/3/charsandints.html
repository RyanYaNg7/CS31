<h2>Characters and Integers</h2>
</div>
<p>
All data in a computer are stored as numbers.  This is true of characters
like <code>'A'</code>, <code>'@'</code>, <code>'&nbsp;'</code>, and
<code>'4'</code>.  Every character has a corresponding integer code.  Different
computers may have different encoding schemes, so the code number
corresponding to the character <code>'A'</code> may be 65 on some machines and
193 on others.  The C++ standard does not dictate which encoding scheme a
system must use.
</p>
<p>
What the C++ standard <em>does</em> dictate is that the code numbers for the
digit characters <code>'0'</code> through <code>'9'</code> must be contiguous
and increasing.  In other words, for any particular encoding scheme, there is
an integer <em>x</em> such that
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'0'</code> has code number <em>x</em></li>
<li><code>'1'</code> has code number <em>x+1</em></li>
<li><code>'2'</code> has code number <em>x+2</em></li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
<li><code>'9'</code> has code number <em>x+9</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
For the ASCII encoding scheme, <em>x</em> happens to be 48, while for
the EBCDIC scheme, it's 240.  However, we should never need to know the
particular value for <em>x</em>.  Let's see why.
</p>
<p>
C and C++ have the following rules:  If a char is used where a number is
required, the compiler causes the program to use the code number for that
character; if a number is used where a char is required, the program uses
the char corresponding to that code number.  So consider this:
</p>
<pre>
char ch = '0';     // Let's say the code number for '0' is <em>x</em>
ch++;              // now ch is '1' (<em>x+1</em>)
ch += 7;           // now ch is '8' (since <em>(x+1)+7</em> is <em>x+8</em>)
int n = ch;        // n is the code number for '8' (i.e., <em>x+8</em>)
int m = ch - '3';  //  '8' - '3'
		   //    which is <em>(x+8) - (x+3)</em>
		   //    which is 8 - 3
		   //    so m is 5
</pre>
<p>
Notice that <code>m</code> will be 5 no matter what encoding scheme our
computer uses (so no matter what value <em>x</em>, the code for
<code>'0'</code>, is).  If it's ASCII, for example, <code>ch</code> ends up
as 56 and <code>'3'</code> is 51, and 56 minus 51 is 5.  If it's EBCDIC,
<code>ch</code> is 248 and <code>'3'</code> is 243, and 248 minus 243 is
5.  In general, your program should never need to use integer constants
like 48 to represent a character code; if you want to represent the code
for the character <code>'0'</code>, for example, just say
<code>'0'</code>, not <code>48</code>.
</p>
<p>
On another note, why do we interpret the sequence of characters consisting of
the digit four, the digit seven, and the digit three as the number four hundred seventy-three?  What if someone revealed the digits to you one at a time?
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to show you some digits, and you tell me what number they
represent.  The first digit is four."<br/>
"OK, I think the number is four."<br/>
"The next digit is seven."<br/>
"Hmmm, I thought the number was four, but there's another digit.  Ten times
four is forty, plus seven is forty-seven.  I think the number is
forty-seven."<br/>
"The next digit is three."<br/>
"Hmmm, I thought the number was forty-seven, but there's another digit.  Ten
times forty-seven is four hundred seventy, plus three is four hundred
seventy-three.  I think the number is four hundred seventy-three."<br/>
"There are no more digits."<br/>
"The number is four hundred seventy-three."
