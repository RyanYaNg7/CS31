<h2>Project 3 FAQ</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>How do I begin?</strong>
</p><p>
First, the announcements dated 10/19/17 are loaded with resources to give
you the tools you need.  Read all the writeups.  Even if you don't see why
they're relevant at first, as you progress in the project you'll be
thinking at various points "Now I need to &hellip;.  Wait!  Didn't I read
something related to that?", and can read the appropriate writeup again,
this time with greater understanding.  Do the Project 3 function practice
exercises to make sure you understand the mechanics of using functions in
C++.
</p><p>
Again, as in Project 2, one secret of success is to develop incrementally.
Work on the easier function first:  <code>hasCorrectSyntax</code>.  Make
a tremendously simplifying assumption:  A song is a song string if it contains
no beats at all.  Get the function working with that simplification:  it
should return true for the empty string, and false otherwise.
</p><p>
This seems ridiculously trivial, but it gets you past an important hurdle.
You now know how to declare a function, implement it, and write a main routine
that tests it.  Further work then becomes merely adjusting the implementation
and the test cases.
</p><p>
Now go with a simplification that is a little less tremendous:  A song is a
song string if it contains no beats at all, or exactly one beat with no
notes at all, or exactly one beat with exactly one note consisting only of
a note letter (no accidental sign or octave digit).  Get the function
working with that simplification, updating and adding to your test cases in
your main routine.
</p><p>
Continue in this manner, removing more and more simplifications until you're
implementing the definition of a song string as in the spec.  There are a
number of orders in which you could remove the simplifications; here's one
such ordering:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
No beats at all.
</li><li>
No beats, or exactly one beat with no note, or exactly one beat with
exactly one note (with no accidental sign or octave number).
</li><li>
Like the previous simplification, but allow an optional accidental sign.
</li><li>
Like the previous simplification, but allow an optional octave digit.  At
this point, your definition of well-formed song is zero or one beat, where a
beat has zero or one note.
</li><li>
Zero or more beats, where a beat has zero or one note.
</li><li>
Zero or more beats, where a beat has zero or more notes.  At this point,
you're implementing what the spec requires of this function.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now that <code>hasCorrectSyntax</code> is correctly implemented, proceed
in a similar fashion to implement <code>encodeSong</code>, starting with
an extreme simplification, then working your way through successive removals
of simpifying assumptions.
</p><p>
As we said in the FAQ for Project 2, it might seem counterintuitive, but
following this incremental approach to developing your program will take
<em>less</em> total time than trying to write the whole thing at once.
</p><p>
At each step where you've got something working, save a copy of the program.
That way, if you mangle things up in the next phase, or you run out of time,
you'll be able to turn in a program that will compile and pass at least
some of our test cases.  That beats getting a zero for correctness!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Can we assume the <code>song</code> parameter never contains
<em>blah blah blah</em>?  Can we assume the <code>song</code> parameter
always contains <em>blah blah blah</em>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
No!  The <code>song</code> parameter might contain <em>any</em> string!
Of course, if that string is not a syntactically correct song string, the
spec tells you what the function must do.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Is such-and-such a syntactically correct song string?</strong>
</p><p>
If you think it is, how many beats does it have?  What are they? Are you
sure they each fit the definition of a beat?  Are you sure that every
character in the supposed song string is part of some beat?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
