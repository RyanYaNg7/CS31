<li>
<p>
<strong>
I don't know where to begin.  What can I do?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Throw away a mindset that says you have to figure out how all the functions
will work before you type in any code.  Start with one function and get
that working &mdash; that will clear up a lot of misconceptions you may have.
</p>
<p>
If you're <em>really</em> stuck, start with this program that solves a
problem that is different, but related, and mutate it into what you want:  
</p>
<pre>
        #include &lt;iostream>
        #include &lt;string>
        #include &lt;cassert>
        using namespace std;

          // Return the position of the first element that is not &lt;= the one
	  // that follows it.  Return &minus;1 if there are no such elements.
        int findFirstDisorder(const string a[], int n)
        {
            for (int k = 0; k &lt; n-1; k++)
	        if (a[k] > a[k+1])
		    return k;
            return -1;
        }

        int main()
        {
            string h[5] = { "clark", "diana", "tony", "selina", "peter" };
            assert(findFirstDisorder(h, 5) == 2);
            assert(findFirstDisorder(h, 4) == 2);
            assert(findFirstDisorder(h, 3) == -1);
            assert(findFirstDisorder(h, 2) == -1);
            assert(findFirstDisorder(h, 1) == -1);
            assert(findFirstDisorder(h, 0) == -1); // No disorder in empty array
              // There should be another test that passes a bad argument
            cout &lt;&lt; "All tests succeeded" &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
I get apparently random results when I try to run some little tests of
the comparison operators on strings.  For example, a test like
<code>"abcde" &lt; "abcxyz"</code> sometimes returns false.  What's going on?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
To get meaningful results, make sure that at least one of the two objects
you are comparing are declared to be of the string type, like <code>s</code>,
<code>t</code>, <code>a[0]</code>, and <code>a[1]</code> below:
</p>
<pre>
string s = "hello";
string t = "help";
string a[2] = { "helping", "hello" };
</pre>
The following are all true:
<pre>
        s &lt; t           // The h's, e's, and first l's match, but s has
                        // an 'l' where t has a 'p', and 'l' &lt; 'p'.
        s &lt; "help"      // True for the same reason.
        t &lt; a[0]        // The first four characters match, then t runs
                        // out while a[0] has more.
        "help" &lt; a[0]   // True for the same reason.
        s == a[1]       // All 5 characters match, and both strings end at
                        // the same time.
        s == "hello"    // True for the same reason
</pre>
<p>
What you cannot do predictably is compare two character string
literals:  <code>"hello" &lt; "help"</code> may be true or false.
A test like this unfortunately will compile.  For technical reasons, what
are being compared are not the characters in the literals, but the addresses
at which the literals are stored, so the result depends on where the
compiler chooses to place the two.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
Blah blah blah if it's equal to the empty string?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
There is absolutely nothing in the spec that specially distinguishes the empty
string (i.e., the string <code>""</code>).  For example, <code>lookup</code>
doesn't treat the empty string as an error.  The empty string is just
another string, no more special than <code>"clark"</code> or
<code>"bruce"</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
What should my functions do if n equals 0?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The spec says: <em>Unless otherwise noted, passing 0 to the function as the
array size is not itself an error; it merely indicates the function should
examine no elements of the array.</em>  So do what makes sense.  For example,
appending something to all <code>n</code> elements of an array when
<code>n</code> is 0 does nothing, because the function will deal with no
elements; that's not an error.  If asked to rotateLeft an element from an
array with no elements of interest, that's as much an error as being asked
to rotateLeft the element at position 8 in a 5-element array, because in
both cases there is no element that the function knows about at the
indicated position, so the function would return &minus;1.  The spec tells
you that the empty sequence is a subsequence of every sequence (even an
empty one), at position 0.
