<h2>Xcode on a Mac</h2>
<p>
Here's how to install Xcode on a Mac and create and run a simple C++
program.  Xcode is an integrated development environment that uses the
clang++ compiler to compile your programs.
</p>
<h3>Installing Xcode</h3>
<p>
Xcode 9.0 is available only for macOS Sierra 10.12.6 or later.
Xcode 8.3.3 is available only for macOS Sierra 10.12 or later.  (Do
<em>not</em> install Xcode 8.3.1 or 8.3, which have a bug that will affect some
programs you'll write.)
XCode 8.2.1 is available only for OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 or later.
Xcode 7.3.1 is available only for OS X El Capitan 10.11 or later.
Xcode 7.2.1 is available for OS X El Capitan 10.11 and Yosemite 10.10.
Xcode can be downloaded for free from
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/downloads/</a>.
</p>
<h3>Creating an Xcode C++ Project</h3>
<p>
Xcode is designed to support developers of large systems, so to
use it as we will initially to write simple one-file programs may seem
like overkill.  However, over time you will come to appreciate some
features (the debugger, especially).
</p><p>
Here is a way to set up an Xcode project to compile and run a
simple one-file program.  A number of these steps may have alternate
ways to achieve the same end.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Start up the Xcode IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select File / New / Project....  You will be asked to choose a template
for your new project.  Select the macOS tab (or OS X), and in the Application
group, select Command Line Tool.  Click Next.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Pick a name for your project as the Product Name, such as "hello".  For
Organization Name, anything will do.  For Organization Identifier, something
simple like "cs31" is good.  For Language, select C++.  Click Next.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the folder in which you want your project folder to be created.  Click
Create.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
In the left frame, click once on the name <code>main.cpp</code> to open
the file, which already has some sample code in it.  Click once again on the
name to rename the file to what you want it to be, such as
<code>hello.cpp</code>.  Click outside the text box to effect the name
change.  Replace the sample code in the edit frame with:
</p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    cout &lt;&lt; "Hey, this really works!" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
From the main menu, select View / Debug Area / Activate Console.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In the upper left corner, click the Run right-facing triangle to build and
run your program.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If your program has any compilation or link errors, you'll be notified.
Click on the little red octagon icon near the top of the window to see the
errors.  Fix the errors.  Go back to step 7.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If your program built successfully, your output will appear in the Output
frame (bottom right below the edit frame).
</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Take heed</h3>
<p>
When running a program that takes input from the keyboard, don't type arrow
keys in the Output frame &mdash; they send strange characters to your
program and may even appear to reorder some of the characters delivered to
the program.
